   - Balance between theoretical foundations and practical implementation
   - Consistency in terminology across all modules (ROS 2, URDF, VSLAM, VLA, etc.)

2. **Educational Structure:**
   - Progressive learning path from fundamentals to capstone project
   - Each module builds upon previous knowledge
   - Hands-on exercises and real-world applications emphasized
   - Weekly breakdown aligned with quarter schedule (13 weeks)

3. **Technical Guidelines:**
   - Code examples must use Python with rclpy for ROS 2 integration
   - Simulation examples demonstrate Gazebo and Unity workflows
   - NVIDIA Isaac platform integration clearly documented
   - Voice-to-Action and LLM integrati"

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" with Content Quality Standards, Educational Structure, and Technical Guidelines. Version 1.0.0 created.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution created/updated.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: None
- 🧠 Reflection: Initial constitution created based on user's request. Further iterations may involve refining principles and propagating changes to other templates.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed:
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
