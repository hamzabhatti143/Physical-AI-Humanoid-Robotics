# Contract: Learning Outcomes for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

**Feature Branch**: `1-docusaurus-book-platform` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: specs/1-docusaurus-book-platform/spec.md
**Input**: User-provided learning outcomes from feature description.

## Summary

This document outlines the measurable learning outcomes that students should achieve upon completing the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book. These outcomes serve as a contract, guiding content creation and ensuring the educational objectives of the course are met. They directly map to the content covered in the Docusaurus-based book.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1.  **Understand Physical AI Principles**: Grasp the core concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence, understanding the transition from digital AI to physical systems interacting with real-world physics.

2.  **Master ROS 2 for Robotic Control**: Demonstrate proficiency in using ROS 2 for robot control, including understanding its architecture, nodes, topics, services, actions, and building Python packages with `rclpy`.

3.  **Simulate Robots with Gazebo and Unity**: Effectively set up and conduct robot simulations using Gazebo for physics and sensor simulation, and Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction.

4.  **Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI Robot Platform**: Utilize the NVIDIA Isaac SDK, Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation, and Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM and navigation, including path planning with Nav2.

5.  **Design Humanoid Robots for Natural Interactions**: Apply principles of kinematics, dynamics, bipedal locomotion, manipulation, and natural human-robot interaction (HRI) design to humanoid robot development.

6.  **Integrate GPT Models for Conversational Robotics**: Integrate GPT and other LLM models for conversational robotics, including using OpenAI Whisper for voice-to-action commands and cognitive planning to translate natural language into ROS 2 actions.
