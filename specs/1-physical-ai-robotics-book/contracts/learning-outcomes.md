# Learning Outcomes for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This document outlines the measurable learning outcomes that students are expected to achieve upon completing the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book. These outcomes serve as a contract between the book and the student, defining the expected knowledge and skills gained.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

1.  **Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence:** Students will be able to define Physical AI, explain its core principles, and articulate the concept of embodied intelligence and its significance in robotics.
2.  **Master ROS 2 for robotic control:** Students will gain proficiency in using ROS 2 concepts (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions), `rclpy` for Python-based robot control, and interpreting URDF for robot descriptions.
3.  **Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity:** Students will be capable of setting up, configuring, and interacting with robot simulations in both Gazebo and Unity, including physics, sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs), and environment building.
4.  **Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform:** Students will be able to utilize NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation, and apply Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM, navigation (Nav2), and reinforcement learning techniques.
5.  **Design humanoid robots for natural interactions:** Students will understand the fundamentals of humanoid kinematics, dynamics, bipedal locomotion, manipulation, grasping, and principles of natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).
6.  **Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics:** Students will acquire the skills to bridge large language models (LLMs) with robotic systems, enabling voice-to-action commands (e.g., using OpenAI Whisper) and cognitive planning to translate natural language into executable robot actions.
