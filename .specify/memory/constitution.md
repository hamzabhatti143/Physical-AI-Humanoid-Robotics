# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Content Quality Standards
- Technical accuracy in AI, robotics, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac concepts.
- Clear explanations suitable for students transitioning from digital AI to physical embodied intelligence.
- Balance between theoretical foundations and practical implementation.
- Consistency in terminology across all modules (ROS 2, URDF, VSLAM, VLA, etc.).

### Educational Structure
- Progressive learning path from fundamentals to capstone project.
- Each module builds upon previous knowledge.
- Hands-on exercises and real-world applications emphasized.
- Weekly breakdown aligned with quarter schedule (13 weeks).

### Technical Guidelines
- Code examples must use Python with rclpy for ROS 2 integration.
- Simulation examples demonstrate Gazebo and Unity workflows.
- NVIDIA Isaac platform integration clearly documented.
- Voice-to-Action and LLM integration.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Complexity must be justified.
