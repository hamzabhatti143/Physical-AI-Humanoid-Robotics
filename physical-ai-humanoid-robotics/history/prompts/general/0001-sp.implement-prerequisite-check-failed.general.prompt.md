## Prompt

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response snapshot

The `/sp.implement` command failed because the feature directory `E:\hackhaton\robotic\specs\1-docusaurus-chatbot-widget` was not found.

To proceed with the implementation, you need to first create the feature structure by running the `/sp.specify` command.

**Follow-up:**
* Run `/sp.specify` to initialize the feature.
* Once the feature structure is in place, you can then re-run `/sp.implement`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Failure to proceed with implementation due to missing feature directory.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: N/A
- 🔁 Next prompts: User needs to run /sp.specify.
- 🧠 Reflection: The /sp.implement command requires the feature directory and tasks.md to exist before execution. The error message from the prerequisite script clearly indicated the missing directory and suggested running /sp.specify. This information was conveyed to the user, and a PHR is being created to document this interaction.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Missing prerequisite files/directories.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): FAIL
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure /sp.specify is run before /sp.implement in future workflows if needed.
