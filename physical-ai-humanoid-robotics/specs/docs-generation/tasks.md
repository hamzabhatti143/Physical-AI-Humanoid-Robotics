# Feature: Documentation Generation

## User Story 1: Generate Missing Documentation Files

**Goal**: Create all specified MDX documentation files with complete content and proper frontmatter.

**Independent Test Criteria**: All four MDX files exist in their respective `docs` subdirectories, contain the expected content (800-1200 words), and have correct MDX frontmatter including title, sidebar position, and description.

### Tasks

- [x] T001 [US1] Generate `docs/module-4-vla/voice-to-action.md`

## Dependencies

- User Story 1: Generate Missing Documentation Files has no external dependencies.

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- All tasks within User Story 1 can be executed in parallel as they involve creating independent files.

## Implementation Strategy

The primary strategy is incremental delivery, focusing on completing each documentation file one by one.

## Completion Validation

- Confirm that `docs/module-1-ros2/week-5-python-rclpy.md` exists and contains relevant content.
- Confirm that `docs/module-1-ros2/urdf-humanoids.md` exists and contains relevant content.
- Confirm that `docs/module-2-digital-twin/week-7-unity-rendering.md` exists and contains relevant content.
- Confirm that `docs/module-4-vla/voice-to-action.md` exists and contains relevant content.
