## Focus: Middleware for robot control

Welcome to Module 1, where we dive into **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**, the foundational middleware that acts as the "nervous system" for modern robotics, especially in complex systems like humanoid robots. This module will explore how ROS 2 enables distributed intelligence, facilitates real-time communication, and provides the essential tools for controlling and coordinating various robotic components.

Throughout this module, we will cover:

-   **Introduction to ROS 2**: What it is, why it's crucial for contemporary robotics, and its evolution from ROS 1.
-   **Core Communication Concepts**: A deep dive into Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions—the building blocks of ROS 2 communication.
-   **Bridging Python Agents to ROS 2 Controllers**: Understanding `rclpy` and how high-level AI agents written in Python can interface with low-level robot hardware.
-   **Understanding URDF for Humanoid Robots**: Exploring the Unified Robot Description Format as the anatomical blueprint for robots and its integration with ROS 2.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of how ROS 2 functions as the central nervous system, linking perception, reasoning, and actuation to bring humanoid robots to life.
