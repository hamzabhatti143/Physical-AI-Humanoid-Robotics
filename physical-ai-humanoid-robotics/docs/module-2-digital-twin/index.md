title: "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)"
---

## Focus: Physics simulation, environment building, and sensor modeling.

Welcome to Module 2, where we explore the concept of **Digital Twins** in robotics, focusing on their implementation using simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity. Digital twins are virtual representations of physical robots and their environments, crucial for development, testing, and deployment workflows without risking physical hardware.

This module will cover:

-   **Introduction to Digital Twins**: Understanding their significance, and the distinctions between low-fidelity (Gazebo) and high-fidelity (Unity) simulators.
-   **Gazebo Simulation Environment**: A deep dive into Gazebo's physics engine, building complex environments, and simulating robot dynamics.
-   **High-Fidelity Simulation in Unity**: Exploring Unity's strengths for realistic rendering, human-robot interaction, and its integration with ROS.
-   **Sensor Simulation**: Techniques for modeling and simulating various robotic sensors, including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs.
-   **Cross-Platform Digital Twin Workflow**: Strategies for synchronizing and leveraging both Gazebo and Unity for comprehensive robotic simulation.

By the end of this module, you will be proficient in creating, populating, and utilizing digital twin environments to accelerate the development and validation of humanoid robotic systems.
